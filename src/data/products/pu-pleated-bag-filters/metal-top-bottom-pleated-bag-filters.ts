Product Overview
Our Metal Top/Bottom Pleated Bag Filters are engineered for high-efficiency dust collection in industrial applications. Featuring pleated media with a metal top and bottom cap, these filters offer a larger filtration surface area compared to standard filter bags— providing longer service life, lower pressure drop, and increased airflow. Ideal for dust collectors in harsh environments such as cement, steel, foundry, woodworking, and chemical processing plants.

Key Features
• Pleated Design with Extended Surface Area: Up to 3–4 times the filtration area of traditional bag filters
• Metal Top & Bottom Caps: Durable, corrosion-resistant, and suitable for high-temp or high-humidity conditions
• High Filtration Efficiency: Captures high-efficiency filtration of fine dust particles
• Easy Installation & Replacement: Compatible with most dust collector systems
• Customizable Sizes and Media: Options for polyester, aramid, PTFE, and more
