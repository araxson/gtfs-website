Product Description
Polyurethane Top/Bottom Pleated Bags provide a unique design that can be easily retrofitted in existing dust collectors, it is Top Load Pleated Bag and Bottom Load Pleated Bag; Polyurethane Pleated Bags to cater demanding application of air pollution control segment. Moulded design of pleated bag is suitable for retrofit to various reputed name in similar segment. Spun bonded filter media offers surface filtration, due to which pleated bags offer very high throughput & lower pressure drop across the filter compared to any conventional tube type filter bags.

Features
(1) Filter area 3 to 4 times Larger than traditional filter bag
(2) Open Pleat Spacing
(3) Low consumption of compressed air (for cleaning)
(4) High efficiency due to surface filtration
(5) Reduction in downtime & maintenance
(6) Easy to install & remove
(7) Leak proof design
(8) Very stable; do not break or fall through sheet
(9) Cages & venture are integral part of bags, hence no cages or venture required

Material of Construction
• Top: Polyurethane
• Bottom: Polyurethane
• Inner: GI Perforated Sheet / SS 304 Perforated Sheet
• Plug: GI
