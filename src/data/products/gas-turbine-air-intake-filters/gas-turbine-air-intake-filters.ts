  description: "Gas turbine air intake filter cartridge with high-efficiency filtration. Features polyester-cellulose-nanofiber media, water-resistant construction, and anti-corrosion frame for power plants.",
  detailedDescription: "Gas Turbine Air Intake Filter cartridges are modern and reliable for air intake applications, protecting turbines from dust and contaminants with high-efficiency filtration for fine particles. They ensure high efficient filtration of dust and other contaminants even in the most polluted environments. Normally these are made of mixture of polyester & cellulose and Nanofiber media with durable media, anti-corrosion frame, and water-resistant construction. These media have much better pleat ability & dimensional stability. Pleated filter media offer high filtration efficiency, very fine retention level, easy clean ability & aesthetically good product than other normal filter media. Features include: (1) Air Intake Cartridges for gas turbines and Air compressors are modern and Reliable. (2) The variety and range of materials and specifications make it possible to find suitable filter media for any environmental conditions. (3) The quality of the materials used ensure high performance standards. Available in comprehensive specifications including multiple models from SFF-01 through SFF-06 in both cylinder and cone shapes, with outer diameters ranging from 324mm to 445mm, inner diameters from 134mm to 330mm, lengths from 559mm to 925mm, and filter areas from 16.4m² to 34.3m². Special configurations include twist lock variants and TenKay type models with specific top cap dimensions. Extensively used in power plants, oil & gas facilities, and compressor systems where reliable air intake filtration is critical for equipment protection and operational efficiency.",
