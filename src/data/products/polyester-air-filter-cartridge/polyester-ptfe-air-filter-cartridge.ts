  description: "Imported spun bonded polyester with PTFE membrane offering high-efficiency filtration. Wide pleat spacing and smooth, hydrophobic PTFE provides excellent particle release. Operating temperature 93-135°C.",
  detailedDescription: "PTFE Filter Cartridge is a membrane-laminated polyester media that provides very high initial efficiency on sub-micron particles. With the addition of the film, almost all particles are immediately stopped by the filter (high-efficiency performance). PTFE membrane media provides the best dust cake release properties. PTFE is nearly chemically inert, a desirable property when dealing with reactive products. Features: (1) Suitable for the filtration of very fine dust type in welding fumes, mechanical processing, pharmaceutical and construction industries and sticky dust collection. (2) Imported spun bonded polyester with PTFE membrane, microporous offers high-efficiency filtration. (3) Wide pleat spacing and smooth, hydrophobic PTFE provides excellent particle release. (4) Excellent resistance to chemical erosion. (5) Electrochemical plate/stainless steel top and bottom, no rust perforated zinc galvanized metal inner core allows good airflow. (6) Applicable temperature: 93-135°C. Available specifications include various models like SFF/F3266 (Φ324mm O.D, Φ213mm I.D, 660mm Length, 9.4m² filtration surface), SFF/F3566, SFF/F3275, SFF/F3288, and SFF/F3290 with different dimensions and filtration surfaces.",
