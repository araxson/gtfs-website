  detailedDescription: `Cylindrical Polyester Filter Cartridge for Industrial Dust Collectors | High Efficiency & Customizable

Product Description
Our Cylindrical Polyester Filter Cartridge is engineered for industrial dust collector systems. Made with premium-grade spunbond polyester, it delivers exceptional filtration efficiency, long service life, and easy maintenance. The cartridge design ensures optimal airflow and dust holding capacity, ideal for various applications such as woodworking, cement, metal processing, and powder coating.

Key Features
• Material: Durable spunbond polyester with optional surface treatments (antistatic, PTFE membrane, fire retardant, etc.)
• Shape: Cylindrical for high dust load and efficient filtration
• Filtration Efficiency: High-efficiency for particles ≥0.3μm
• End Cap: Galvanized steel or plastic; corrosion-resistant
• Gasket: Seamless polyurethane or rubber for airtight sealing
• Customization: OEM sizes, media options, and end caps available

Advantages
• Robust construction for extended filter life
• Optimized pleat design for high dust holding capacity
• Wide compatibility with various industrial dust collectors
• Resistant to moisture, chemicals, and temperature fluctuations
